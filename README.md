Vamp is the Very Awesome Microservices Platform. Vamp's core features are a platform-agnostic microservices DSL, easy A-B testing/canary releasing on everything and a deep and extendable metrics engine that monitors everything and directly feeds back into your services.

Vamp is open source and mostly written in Scala, with some
parts in Go. 
> Vamp is currently in [alpha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha).


## Deploy Vamp on your laptop

Vamp can run on your laptop with one command. Check out our [Docker quick start](http://vamp.io/getting-started). This should be enough to kick the tires.

## Deploy Vamp with a Mesosphere backend

Vamp uses underlying PaaS and container management platforms like Mesosphere. This is how you run Vamp
[on a Mesosphere cluster](http://vamp.io/documentation/installation/container_drivers/#mesosphere-marathon). This should work on Google Compute Engine, Digital Ocean or anywhere where Mesos runs.
